                                <img src="img/sarahThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Lindsey" />
                            The bride, Lindsey, has always dreamed of starting a family of her own. Born in Austria and traveling the globe as an infant instilled a thirst for exploration, culture and, nature in her.  Her sense of adventure lead her into the back bayous of Mississippi where her older brother, Josh, and she would swim, fish and capture any creature they could bring home to surprise Mom with before dinner! Moving to Connecticut in elementary school lead her to the beach. As Lindsey's independence grew stronger the small shore town did not offer the diversity she was craving. Her sights were now set on the suburbs of the biggest city in the world, NYC. Moving to West Orange, NJ for her high school years was much more of a change than Lindsey could have ever expected. <br/><br/>After four years and a best friendship built with one of her bridesmaids, Mariann, it was off to college for a degree in psychology from Montclair State University. While attending school Lindsey established a position as an office manager for Procare Medical Associates, which she recently celebrated her 11th year with the practice. Finishing her undergraduate studies she was than accepted into Rutger's Univerisity's graduate program for Social Work, finishing with highest honors. During her time at Rutgers, through mutual friends she and her groom, Carlos, started a friendship which grew into a love which bring us all together. Lindsey looks forward to what exciting adventures becoming a wife and building a family will bring her. </p>

                                Born in Lakewood NJ, Carlos spent 18 years of his life in the suburbs of Ocean County and the latter 10 years in Newark NJ at NJIT. Carlos grew up in the pinelands of New Jersey with his brother and family. He survived Manchester TWP's education while playing instruments in the band, learning how to build computers and modifying/breaking anything available. Tinkering with electronics and cars has helped cultivate him into the person he is today and ultimately was the catalyst to pursing an engineering degree.<br/><br/> After many Devils games and too much time in Newark, Carlos graduated from The New Jersey Institute of Technology earning a Bachelors in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Master of Science in Engineering Management. Carlos started his professional career at Avalue Technology in the embedded hardware industry and changed paths to explore the tech startup scene in New York. With an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for technology, Carlos now works for The Printer Source as a Web Developer/ Sales Engineer.  Carlos is looking forward to starting a family with Lindsey and being the foundation of a generation of Salazar's.</p>

                                    <h2>HOW WE MET</h2>
                                    <p>This story begins in an unexpected place; the inner city of Newark, NJ in an off-campus apartment on Norfolk St.  The Norfolk st apartment saw many tenants come and go and one Spring, shortly after Lindsey finished her graduate degree, a vacancy in this notorious apartment opened up. Lindsey inquired through a friend and moved up the hill from her James St. apartment.<br />
                                        From there, Carlos and Lindsey became roommates and over time the friendship grew. Somewhere along the crazy ride, the friendship outgrew its capacity and developed into an inseparable love. The two are recently engaged when Carlos proposed to Lindsey at a Karaoke Bar in New Orleans. <br />
                                    <br/><br/><b>Fun Fact:</b> Karaoke is a recurring theme in the relationship; Bump and grind was Carlos' song choice for their first date in a karaoke bar by Penn Station. The two are celebrating 9 years of companionship &amp; friendship this June.</p>

The estate sits on 2 acres of manicured gardens with a moat going around the property that has two cascading waterfalls. It is located in walking distance to the Bridgeton downtown and the local Bridgeton Zoo.<br /> <br />The walls in the formal rooms are troupe L'oeil and there is a summerhouse gazebo that seats 12 for meals. There is a private dock for swimming and paddle boating, rafts and other outdoor/swimming gear. Just miles from Philadelphia and the beautiful Jersey Shore. 50 miles to Atlantic City. Bridgeton is a lovely Victorian town that is undiscovered and the surrounding countryside is unspoiled. A perfect setting for a beautiful wedding.
